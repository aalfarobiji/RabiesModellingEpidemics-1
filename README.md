# RabiesModellingEpidemics-1
Find the suitable model in Indonesia situation (low/middle/high dog population)

## There are 6 files:
- ArcGISMap
- 3 Districts (Fatukopa, Kota Soe, and Toianas)
- RMSE
- Outbreak Duration and Rt

  ## The process of the modelling
  - Make random points as dog coordinate in ArcGIS in file ArcGISMap
  - After get the coordinate, implement them in model to find the best suitable model (low/middle/high population) in files 3 districts (Fatukopa, Kota Soe, and Toianas)
  - Analysis the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in file RMSE
  - Analysis the Outbreak Duration and Rt in file Outbreak Duration and Rt
